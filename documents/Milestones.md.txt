First I want to consider a simple version of MHE with RTI. 

Hence I first consider the setting with:
- no algebraic variables 
- no state noise (only measurement noise)
- all measurement noises have the same covariance, hence V_k=V for all k.
- ODE can have controls in the setting with nmpc
- No further parameters
- fixed end time

As an application I would use
- the pyridine example for MHE parameter estimation without nmpc
- the pendulum example for MHE with nmpc, where the unknown parameter 
is e.g. the friction constant (here I maybe have to reformulate the ODE such that it takes the friction into account.....)

I want to implement MHE with the classical GGN-rti step and for better performance also with one ipopt step

MS1: Implement the arrival cost
MS2: Implement constructor of multiple shooting setting -> maybe define again parametric s.t. F1(w,arr,y_new)
MS3: Implement MHE-RTI with ipopt and GGN
MS4: Apply to double-pendulum without controls and friction constants as parameters. use h=id as in project 1


Setup for the MHE with the double pendulum (simlpest case- no controls):
- set predef. parameters (friction coefficients), simulate with these, generate perturbed measurements
- use double pendulum ode
- set u = 0 everywhere
- start with pendulum close to top
- measure the states -> h(x)=x

-> di ipy widget comparison of true trajectory, pertrubed one and optimized one (as in symplectic seminar)
